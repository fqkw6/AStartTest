Lockstep Framework
------------------------
The Lockstep Framework (LSF) is a framework designed for games that especially need lockstep simulations. It includes a deterministic 2D physics engine, pathfinding, behavior system, and more. LSF is integrated with Unity.

Special thanks to Liv Games (http://www.livgames.com) and 360 Studio (http://www.360studio.me) for supporting the development of Lockstep Framework.

Under development by [John Pan](https://github.com/SnpM), Lam Pham (https://github.com/LamPham), and GladFox (https://github.com/GladFox).

Features
__________
- Deterministic math library and simulation logic
- 2D physics engine on the X-Z plane.
- Behaviour system for both individual agents and globally
- Lockstep variables - know when and where desyncs happen
- Size-based pathfinding (big units won't get stuck in those narrow gaps)
- Customizable database system
- Support for Forge Networking (DarkRift and Photon coming soon)
- 3D Raycasting

Quick Setup
-----------
1. Import the framework into a Unity project and open Lockstep-Framework/Example/ExampleScene
2. Set up the database and settings by navigating to the Lockstep/Database window or pressing Control - Shift - L.
3. In the Settings foldout of the database window, click Load and navigate to Lockstep-Framework/Example/ExampleDatabase/Example_Database.asset to load the preconfigured database for the example.
4. Play!

Note: The example only shows the basic functionality of the framework. Comprehensive examples will be added close to the end of core development.

TODO:
-------
These are high priority issues that are significantly big or complicated. Any help on these aspects (as well as on any other lacking parts of the framework) would be very appreciated.
- Interpolation. Through a combination of interpolation and extrapolation on unexpectedly late simulation frames, interpolation works correctly without another layer so the unit will always only be 1 frame behind the actual position. For some reason, there's still some smooth stuttering when VSync is turned off in the editor. The brunt of the interpolation code stems from PhysicsManager.Visualize().
- (After Lockstep Variables are fully tested) Lockstep Variable integration. Currently, no abilities use Lockstep Variables which are used to track determinism and also reset values upon re-initialization of the unit. A lot of work must be done to mark as many value-type deterministic variables as possible [Lockstep] and move their initialization to Setup () since LSVariables automatically handle resetting.
- Safe and scalable coding patterns. Anywhere you see something that might cause problems for a large-scale project, fixing it or raising an issue would be a big help. LSF started as a work of curiosity and passion. While it's introduced me to helpful experiences, I didn't always see the flaw in using statics everywhere. If there are any significantly limiting problems with a component's design, I'll do my best to fix it.
- Implement and test polygon colliders.
- Deterministic heightmap system with possibly multiple layers

Road Map
---------
- Gamestate syncing... probably need to flesh out Lockstep Variables for this.

Ability Pattern
----------------
Abilities are moddable behaviors that can be easily attached, detached, and moddified on prefab game objects. They follow the following pattern:
- The overridable Initialize() method is called when the agent the ability belongs to is created and initialized. It provides an argument that is the agent the ability belongs to. Because LSF uses object pooling, the Ability must also be reset in Initialize(). Note: Lockstep varaibles are implemented but not tested. These will make resetting in Initialize obsolete.
- Simulate() is called every single simulation frame (FixedUpdate frames).
- Visualize is called every render frame (Update frames).
- Deactivate() is called when the ability's agent is deactivated (i.e. killed). Note that Simulate() will not be called until after Initialize() is called again.

ActiveAbility Pattern
_____________________________
ActiveAbility inherits from Ability and includes all the patterns described above. In addition ActiveAbilitys can be interacted with by players through Commands.
- Execute () is called when a Command is received and activates the ability. This method provides an argument that is the Command responsible for the ability's activation.
